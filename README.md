# 🩺 Maternal Mortality Policy Analysis — Research Database

**Independent Maternal Mortality Research — Hospital Policy Focus**

Welcome to my independent research database on maternal mortality policies.  
This repository tracks and organizes data related to hospital policies, state legislation, funding, and key policy actors impacting maternal mortality rates in the U.S., with a starting focus on Missouri.

The ultimate goal is to help clarify how health policies, hospital practices, and systemic structures influence preventable maternal deaths — especially severe medical events that can be mitigated through timely detection, intervention, and systemic reform.
